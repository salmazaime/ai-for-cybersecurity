# AI for Cybersecurity Project (Future Focus)

**Project Idea:** Dedicated repository for future projects leveraging Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence for security outcomes, such as anomaly detection in user behavior or automated threat scoring.

**Status:** Currently researching appropriate datasets and model types (e.g., NLP for phishing analysis, unsupervised models for anomaly detection).

**What it will demonstrate:**
* Intent to engage with cutting-edge technologies (AI/ML).
* Foundational understanding of how machine learning can be applied to large security datasets.
* Ability to start and structure an R&D project.
